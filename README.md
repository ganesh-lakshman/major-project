Self Driving Cars

Self-driving vehicles  were introduced in the US and were later criticized for their errors and unreliability. But we see autonomous vehicles as the future. Sooner or later improved technology is going to change our lives. 
Machines will imitate human behavior in unforeseen manner. But India due to its terrain, traffic and economy lacks in the autonomous vehicles segment. India needs to be ready for a revolution in the automobile industry. Infrastructure is going to remain the same at least for decades, our infrastructure like roads are well thought out for the Indian economy. 
Roads in rural parts of India are designed economically efficient, they were built without disturbing the local ecosystem. Also, due to weather conditions in India, roads are frequently damaged. Hence resulting in twists and turns. So we cannot expect major infrastructural change, but the autonomous vehicle technology is already there and is improving day by day. India needs to adapt this technology smartly by tweaking algorithms but not infrastructure.
Our project is to train, improve and modify these self-driving machine learning models to Indian Roads and driving psychology. 

Ex: In the US they use traffic cones, in India we rarely see cones we use barriers. There is a huge chance that a machine might think it's just another car and make wrong decisions.
